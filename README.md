# PROJECT-1 Swift And OOP `(Deadline: Sunday - 31 OCT - 2021)`
Congratulations on completing the first phase of the course! To reinforce your learning from the Swift Essentials, it‚Äôs time for you to build a program from scratch. 

## Requirements
The program you are required to do in your first project is a Todo-List program; and you are requested to show the program in the xcode terminal as a CMD, in other words, it doesn't include interfaces and doesn't use the GUI.
The features that should be implemented are as follows:
- As a user, I should be able to create a new todo by providing its name and description and the deadline of the todo.
- The deadline of the todo should be optional; As I user, I can choose to make the todo with or without a deadline.
- It's enough for the deadline to be date, no need to make it as date & time.
- As a user, I should be able to list and see all of my todos that I already added.
- As a user, I should be able to select any of the todos and update its information (such as: name, description, date).
- As a user I should be able to remove a todo from the todo list by writing the number of the todo in the list. (the number represents the order of the todo).

## Extra Requirements (Bonus)
- As a user, I should be able to reorder the todos by the nearest deadline.
- As a user, I should be able to reorder the todos by the farthest deadline.
- As a user, if I order the todos by the deadline, then I should be able to return them back to the original order (by creation time).
- As a user, I should be able to check the todo which indicates that the todo is done.
- As a user, I should be able to uncheck any checked (done) todo; so that I return it back to its orginal status.

# Presentation
- Every student is supposed to present their project individually, but this time, it won't be in front of the class, but it will be kind of one-to-one disucssion with me.
- In the presentation, I will make sure that you understand what your code and what you did in the project.
- You should show me the different programming concepts and tools you used in your project (such as: classes, structs, prtocols, closures, functions, try-catch.. etc).

---
## Notes
- Make sure to show friendly messages all over your program so that the user can understand where he/she is and now what they need to do in order to use any of the features mentioned above.
- You are required to make all the requirements to get the full mark (3/3). The extra requirements are optional, but doing them will grant you extra mark (4/3).
- Make sure you handle any wrong input from the user and to show them a friendly message when they make any, for example, if a user enters a random text in the date input, then you should inform them that the input is invalid.
- Try to use the concepts that you learn in Swift as much as you can whenever needed, (such as: classes, structs, prtocols, closures, functions, try-catch.. etc); doing that will increase your score or at least make you safe from deduction because of any other problem.
- **IMPORTANT: Don't fork - pull request, you should make your own repository in github and upload your project to it** 


Goood Luck on your first project guys üëåüèªüî•
